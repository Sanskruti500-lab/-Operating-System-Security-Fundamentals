OS Security Fundamentals 
What is OS Security?
OS (Operating System) security means protecting the computer system from misues & attacks by using basic security settings
What is OS Hardening? 

OS Hardening means making an operating system more secure by reducing risks
👉 It is done by:
	•	Removing unnecessary features
	•	Limiting user access
	•	Securing system settings🔐 Examples of OS Hardening
	•	Using strong passwords
	•	Disabling unnecessary services
	•	Enabling firewall
	•	Giving minimum permissions to users
	•	Keeping the OS updated
	•	Securing file permissions
  1️⃣ What are file permissions in Linux?

File permissions in Linux decide who can read, write, or execute a file.

There are three permissions:
	•	r (read) – view the file
	•	w (write) – edit the file
	•	x (execute) – run the file

And three types of users:
	•	Owner
	•	Group
	•	Others
  2️⃣ Why should unnecessary services be disabled?

Unnecessary services run in the background and increase security risk.

Reasons:
	•	Reduce attack surface
	•	Improve system performance
	•	Save memory and CPU
	•	Prevent unauthorized access
  Why should unnecessary services be disabled?
  Simple Reasons:
	1.	Reduce attack surface – Fewer services mean fewer ways for attackers to enter.
	2.	Improve security – Unused services may have vulnerabilities.
	3.	Save system resources – Less CPU and memory usage.
	4.	Better performance – System runs faster.
	5.	Prevent unauthorized access – Reduces chances of misuse.
 Understanding OS-level security and hardening
 OS-level security means protecting the operating system so that only authorized users can access it and use its resources safely.

OS hardening is the process of making the operating system more secure by reducing weaknesses and limiting what users and programs can do.
🔐 Key Concepts of OS-Level Security
	1.	User Accounts & Access Control
	•	Different users have different permissions
	•	Prevents unauthorized access
	2.	File Permissions
	•	Controls who can read, write, or execute files
  ⚙️Conclusion

Operating system security helps protect the system from unauthorized access and attacks. By applying basic OS hardening techniques, system security and reliability are improved.
